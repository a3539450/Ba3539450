<h3>Oscilloscope</h3>

<p>Touching the display will produce a vertical index line, which will
show the value at that point. The value is arbitrary, as there is
automatic gain control on the input so the trace does not get
clipped. The position of the index can be finely adjusted by rolling
the finger tip. The index can be removed by swiping it off to the
left, or touching the Start icon.</p>

<p>Touch the left edge Y scale to adjust the sync level. A pointer will
appear which can be adjusted by sliding up and down. Touch the start
icon to reset the level to zero.</p>

<p>In single shot mode the timebase may be changed to zoom in and pan
left and right using the right and left icons.</p>

<h3>Spectrum</h3>

<p>The spectrum display shows a spectrum with a logarithmic frequency
scale. An index line shows the dominant frequency in the input. The
frequency and input level is also displayed in the toolbar. To lock
the display, touch spectrum the display or the lock icon in the
toolbar. Touch it again to release the lock. To display the help
screen, touch the help icon.</p>

<h3>Settings</h3>

be available, depending on the device. The fill option selects
